<p>Too many so-called horror anime rely only on blood and death to provide the horror and this to me is not horror. Finally an anime is recommended to me as a horror anime and Another really is. Horror is not a genre that in my opinion is well represented in anime. The story focuses on a boy named Kōichi Sakakibara who upon transferring into Yomiyama Middle School and meeting the curious Mei Misaki finds himself in a mystery revolving around students and people related to his class falling victim to gruesome senseless deaths. Meaning they had to be a student headassistant teacher a member of the family who died before they made it to their third year.</p>
