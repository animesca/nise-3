<p>Another is a horror-filled anime about the death of a student. If playback doesnt begin shortly try. This caused a strange and unexplainable phenomenon that persists to this day. Also none of them appear in the live-action film. An Isekai or Alternate world is a genre of anime involving accidental travelling from one boring real-world location to a fantasy world where the rules of science go out of the window.</p>

<p>After Takako died in episode 11 she was replaced by Sayuri Kakinuma. Another at Anime News Network. Not die in the inn either killed by Keiko Numata novel or die in the fire at the Inn manga. However theres a character with some similarities with Takako. Looking for information on the anime Another.</p>

<p>Misaki Yomiyama - Died in a house fire off-screen mentioned. I love the concept of isekai anime and Im sure most of you do too. He has been replaced with Mikami-Sensei. In 1972 a popular student died midway through the year. Fast-forward to 1998 when Koichi Sakakibara starts school.</p>
