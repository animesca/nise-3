<p>Male anime eyes are usually smaller and narrower than female anime eyes. They really show the character’s feelings. To draw the eyes closed, just draw the upper eyelids like you normally would—a downward curving line for female anime eyes or a horizontal line with a slight curve for male anime eyes. This is especially so for female characters who often have larger and wider eyes than their male counterparts. As we move down you can tell as the eyes get squinter the more intense the feeling is.</p>
