<p>Yeah thats probably what theyll call it. The Restaurant To Another World Season 2 anime TV series is confirmed for Fall 2021. Mostly Im looking forward to what Lyrical Lily will sound like dubbed as well as Rondo and Merm4id even though we heard them before but only a little. Dont Toy With Me Miss Nagatoro has announced that Season 2 of the anime is now in the works. But fret not even though NGNL Season 1 released in 2014 the series is still going strong and might be well on its way for a Season 2 announcement.</p>

<p>The Restaurant To Another World Season 2 anime TV series is confirmed for Fall 2021. By Mercedez Clewis Nov 9th 2021. Looking for information on the anime 86 Part 2 86 Eighty-Six. If Cowboy Bebop were to score a second season renewal it would be safe to assume that the shows core trio would return comprised of John Cho Spike Spiegel. Vladilena Milizé continues to operate as Handler.</p>
