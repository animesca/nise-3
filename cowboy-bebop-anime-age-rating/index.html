<p>Action drama science fiction Age rating. For over 20 years Cowboy Bebop has built a legacy that has captivated audiences new and old and will continue to live on for eons. Cowboy Bebop isnt deep but it has style and little bits of creativity everywhere to make up for what it lacks in substance and from start to finish its a marvelously well-built production. I can believe Spike is 27 looking at his character design but considering his past personality etc. Worth at least a chance from almost any anime fan and is almost guaranteed to be loved by fans of stylish action and sci-fi as well those into both not-too-serious space adventure and way-too-serious space adventure.</p>
