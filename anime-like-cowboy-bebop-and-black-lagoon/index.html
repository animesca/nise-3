<p><strong>Anime Like Cowboy Bebop And Black Lagoon</strong>. While Cowboy Bebop is more futuristic and not as over the top as Black Lagoon it is still a great series that you should watch if you enjoyed Black Lagoon as a matter of fact most people would say Cowbyo Bebop is the better of the 2 animes and it is also in most peoples top 10-15 of animes. Within Thailand is Roanapur a depraved crime-ridden city where not even the authorities or churches are untouched by the claws of corruption. Characters are like both mugen and revy are very close while jin is like spike. Michiko is a sexier and more feminine version of Revy and Black Lagoon is simply a more hard-boiled concept of underworld life than MtH.</p>

<p>Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor 2 the Movie. Both the Netflix version and the original Cowboy Bebop anime have elements of Afrofuturism from the jazz-infused score and structure to characters like Jet Black. While Cowboy Bebop is more futuristic and not as over the top as Black Lagoon it is still a great series that you should watch if you enjoyed Black Lagoon as a matter of fact most people would say Cowbyo Bebop is the better of the 2 animes and it is also in most peoples top 10-15 of animes. It is how ever a sword is a sword not some fantastical mythical weapon though the animation is good and. But this is samurai and swords not gun play. Recommend me good anime Thread starter watcher.</p>
<h3 id="like-a-bit-of-both">Like a bit of both.</h3><p>A haven for convicts and degenerates alike the city is notorious for being the center of illegal activities and operations often fueled by local. Black Lagoon is a story about a band of modern pirates who do their dirty jobs to survive in a very harsh world. Not only is the dialogue better and cooler in Black Lagoon but the characters are better and the weight. Samurai Champloo is a pretty obvious recommendation for people who like Cowboy Bebop. It is how ever a sword is a sword not some fantastical mythical weapon though the animation is good and. Assuming you like the idea of feisty foul-mouthed women in hot pants completely dominating a show and giving everyone involved a wild ride then Michiko to Hatchin and Black Lagoon are quite nicely matched.</p>
