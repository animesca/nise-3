<p>School uniform a type of uniform worn in japanese schools (called seifuku in japanese), generally high school age or younger. The anime was about a young girl who became part of a freak show and ritually abused and humiliated until she met an ally in the form of a mystical dwarf magician. She has a bit of trouble acting natural in front of the camera at first, and prefers taking pictures of others. Because of her father�s debts, she�s kicked out of her own home and has to rely on her own connections to survive. Roman academy (浪漫学園 rōman gakuen) which teaches students from 15 to 18 years of age, is the high school which many characters attend. As already outlined in his shojo tsubaki chapter of das ungetum, the old kami shibai became now something new altogether.</p>
