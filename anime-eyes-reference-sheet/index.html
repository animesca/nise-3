<p>Feel free to explore, study and enjoy paintings with paintingvalley.com Anime eyes of younger male characters are often drawn very similar to or exactly the same as those of female characters. A character reference sheet is a good tool for keeping track of the various aspects of your character when writing fiction or developing characters for games.
