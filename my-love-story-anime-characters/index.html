<p>(for instance on the adorable. My top 30 most favorite �love story/romance� movies! Looking for information on the anime ore monogatari!! First of all, the main male lead is not the typical definition of attractive. This romance anime portrays this beautiful message through its main characters and their journey to let go of the past and strive to grasp a brighter future.</p>

<p>Create lists for what you�ve seen &amp; read, watch over 40,000 legal streaming episodes online, and meet other anime fans just like you. Characters, voice actors, producers and directors from the anime ore monogatari!! A part of the character cast from the anime “my love story!!” has already been entered into our database. Takeo is a very kind person who uses his amazing physical abilities to help people, but he�s never had any luck with girls because they think he�s ugly or intimidating.every girl takeo falls for seems to be attracted. It was fun in the beginning, kinda felt like it dragged on a bit in the second part but generally, it was a cute romcom movie for sure!</p>
