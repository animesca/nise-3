<p>Mikasa and eren are a couple, as opposed to adopted siblings. On myanimelist, and join in the discussion on the largest online anime and manga database in the world! First thing is you shouldn�t compare the series with the movie.

<p>The story presented in the manga is way better for the reasons mentioned above. Waiting months for it to finish and watch all at once was a neck breaker but it left me amazed and craving more.
