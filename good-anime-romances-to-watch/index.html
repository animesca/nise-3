<p>Top 10 best fantasy romance anime. I really need a good anime this time ! The anime stays true to its slice of life and the shoujo tag. Still, i recommend you to give it a try. Nagi no asukara knows how to represent their characters and develop them from poorly written looking characters to stronger and likable ones, but as far as the romance goes it�s focused on romance, unlike many animes where people only fall in love with the one with the biggest.</p>

<p>I felt its a good anime but dont know why they have given a less score for that. Of the shallow pool that is actual yuri anime, sakura trick stands out as not being full drama all the time, but also in showing the characters actually doing gay things. If you’re looking for a cute and meaningful romance anime, this series is perfect for you. The romance in this anime is subtle, yet harmonizes perfectly with the rest of the show. If you�re looking for a great anime kids movie, the best place to start is studio ghibli.</p>

<p>I felt its a good anime but dont know why they have given a less score for that. This is the anime you want to watch. I need one with a good animation, awesome story plot and a good looking guys and girls ;) and please don`t suggest any anime that is the opposite of what i just said. I just had this thought that i want to watch an anime where the main character is a cool bad guy who doesn�t give a shit about anyone. If you�re looking for a great anime kids movie, the best place to start is studio ghibli.</p>

<p>(we�re looking at you, my love story.) Why it made the list: Also, a short summary for the show is as follows. They both create an alliance with one another and end up getting married to get more points using each other�s powers, but also create a bond that exceeds their virtual reality game. Some people like true romances, some like romcoms, and others like to cry a whole lot.</p>
