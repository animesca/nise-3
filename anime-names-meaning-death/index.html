<p>Now i know where to look if i ever need baby names! While some death names are unsurprisingly dark, others use names of gods of death or more celebratory meanings. Carries a scepter and lance on a horse adramelech chancellor and president of the high council of devils. It�s a shame that it sounds so beautiful yet it has such deadly meaning! Name of the character in the japanese series death note.</p>
