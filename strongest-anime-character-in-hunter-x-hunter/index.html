<p>He killed so many people but he is still the fastest, strongest, most amazing character in hunter x hunter. Even thought he didn�t pass the test the first time he is still the strongest character in hunter x hunter. My favourite villain in anime and by far my favourite character in hunter x hunter! Hunters are specialized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from treasure hunting to cooking.

<p>Top 70 strongest hunter x hunter characters this is my attempt at a top strongest list.everyone is ranked at their peak i tried to only rank those who have enough feats but there was a bit of speculation involved.tell me what do you think.this is based on combination of combat capability,skill and inteligence. Although, we would like to consider including those characters with extensive potential to surpass some of the characters in the top 12; Undoubtedly, sequant is one of the most inefficient hunters in the series. Since 1998, hunter x hunter has been one of shonen jump’s most popular series. It has produced a manga as well as two anime and movie adaptations.</p>
