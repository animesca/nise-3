<p>For the record, i did try to use the snapchat cat filter on one of my dogs and it didn�t work. Anime style is a snapchat filter so it only works via that app. Hopefully this new snapchat filter for cats is a sign of good things to come for dogs. Want to know what you’d look like if you were a puppy? As you see here, it dyed my brown hair to a frightful silver/grey, though my darker roots are still visible, and it ravaged my face.</p>
