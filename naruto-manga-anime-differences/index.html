<p>Naruto next generations fans have been able to experience the series in two distinct ways. Although i agree with everything in nevios� answer, from another lens, i would also say that the manga and anime are different because the manga only comes out once per month and the anime would be ahead of the manga which is a no go because the manga is typically looked at as canon or the actual story line while animes have the luxury of having fillers or story lines separate from, and in some cases, alternative to the actual story itself. A l�instar de dragon ball super (lire notre comparatif entre le manga et l’anime), la série animée boruto s�est démarquée en développant une histoire totalement inédite du manga, laissant. Anime &amp; manga stack exchange is a question and answer site for anime and manga fans.
